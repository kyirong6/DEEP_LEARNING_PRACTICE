# DEEP_LEARNING_PRACTICE

## Some guides and example code for deep learning in pytorch. 

#### 1. MNIST
An initial tutorial of basic feed forward neural network concepts using pytorch. Fundamental NN concepts are assumed to be known. This data set is extremely well known and is a popular starting guide for DL. It is used for a simple classification task of identifying hand written digits from 0-9. Moreover, the data set is unreasonably optimized and centered for clarity and ease of use. We cannot expect this in the real world.
